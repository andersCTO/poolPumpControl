# Pool Pump Controller using LilyGO T-Relay ESP32

This project automates the control of a pool circulation pump and heater to minimize electricity costs while maintaining proper water quality and temperature. It uses a [LilyGO T-Relay ESP32 module](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-Relay) and connects to an **AquaForte VARIO+ II** (model Vario+ 1100) frequency inverter via digital output.

## Project Goals

1. **Automated pool water circulation** based on electricity prices.
2. **Optimized pump speed control** via RS485 or digital relay control.
3. **Future expansion** to include heater control and external sensors (e.g., temperature).
4. **WiFi-connected** and fetches day-ahead electricity spot prices automatically.
