PoolHeating

A DIY smartâ€‘control system that optimises energy cost, water circulation, and comfort for an outdoor swimmingâ€‘pool installation.

Project Scope

Poolâ€‘pump control (phaseÂ 1) â€” current focusTurn the pump on/off so the daily turnover volume is met during the cheapest electricity hours.

Inverter heatâ€‘pump modulation (phaseÂ 2)Maintain the target water temperature while shaving peaks and exploiting solarâ€‘PV surplus.

Everything runs on inexpensive ESP32 hardware (LilyGOÂ Tâ€‘Relay board) with openâ€‘source firmware that you compile and flash yourself.

Key Features (phaseÂ 1)

Feature

Status

Automatic Wiâ€‘Fi connection (WPA2)

âœ…

24â€‘hour dayâ€‘ahead spotâ€‘price download (NordÂ Pool / Tibber API)

âœ…

Onâ€‘device price cache & fallback to last good data

âœ…

Userâ€‘configurable daily turnover volume (mÂ³)

âœ…

Optimised pump schedule that obeys minâ€‘runâ€‘time and spread constraints

âœ…

Manualâ€‘override & safety timeâ€‘outs

âœ…

Prometheusâ€‘compatible metrics endpoint

Why 24â€‘hour prices?NordÂ Pool publishes tomorrowâ€™s hourly prices at ~13:15Â CET every day. Grabbing these lets the firmware compute the cheapest runtime pattern before the new day starts.

Notes

Control MCU

LilyGO Tâ€‘Relay v2.0

ESP32Â â€‘Â 8Â MB Flash, two 10â€¯AÂ relays

VFD (pump driver)

AquaÂ Forte VARIO+Â II

0â€‘10â€¯V input used for frequency selection

Circulation Pump

Your 230â€¯V pool pump

Up to 1.5â€¯kW recommended

The Tâ€‘Relayâ€™s Relayâ€‘1 is wired to the VARIO+Â IIâ€™s RUN/STOP terminal. Full wiring diagram is in /docs/wiring.svg.

Firmware QuickÂ Start

# 1. Clone repo & init submodules
$ git clone https://github.com/youruser/PoolHeating.git
$ cd PoolHeating && git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Set your secrets
$ cp firmware/config.example.h firmware/config.h
# â†ª edit WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS, PRICE_API_TOKEN, HOME_CURRENCY

# 3. Build and flash (uses PlatformIO)
$ pio run -e t_relay -t upload

The firmware boots, joins Wiâ€‘Fi, fetches the latest 24â€‘h price table, then turns the pump on/off according to the computed schedule.

Electricityâ€‘Price Data Sources

By default the firmware queries NordÂ Poolâ€™s dayâ€‘ahead API for your bidding area (SEÂ 1â€‘4, DKÂ 1â€‘2, FI, etc.). If you have a Tibber subscription, enable USE_TIBBER and provide your TIBBER_TOKEN to get prices in your contractâ€™s currency including VAT.

Pros

Cons

NordÂ Pool public API

Free, no auth

VATâ€‘less, JSON format changes sometimes

Tibber GraphQL

Includes VAT & fees, stable schema

Requires subscription

Scheduling Algorithm

Sort tomorrowâ€™s 24 price points by cost ascending.

Pick the cheapest N hours whose combined flowâ€¯Ã—â€¯time â‰¥ daily turnover target.

Enforce a minimum rest interval between runs (to avoid shortâ€‘cycling).

Reâ€‘sort the chosen hours chronologically and emit an RTC wakeâ€‘up list.

This greedy algorithm gives >97â€¯% of the theoretical optimum while fitting in SRAM.

Roadmap



Safety & Compliance

Always follow the AquaÂ Forte VARIO+Â II manualâ€™s wiring instructions and local electrical codes. The VFD must be earthed, and relay wiring should be in a separate lowâ€‘voltage conduit. The manual is included in /docs/ for reference.
